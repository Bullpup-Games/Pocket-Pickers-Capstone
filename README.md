# How To Play 

Pocket Pickers is a game where you play as a bank robber who died. 
You now find yourself in hell, where your sins are being stored in a
protected vault. Using your skills, along with a magic playing card,
you run through the vault to steal your sins back!


# Objective

There are several glowing sin objects hidden throughout the level.
Your goal is to avoid detection by enemies, and navigate your way 
to collect these sin objects, and then make it out without being caught.
This game is designed to be played through multiple runs, as each sin 
you collect will make the enemies more dangerous. Whether one-by-one or
few-by-few, reclaim the sins binding you to hell and escape!
